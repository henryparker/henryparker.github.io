## About me

Hi! I‚Äôm a Master‚Äôs student in Data Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work on visual representation learning, generative modeling, and robot perception at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. My long-term goal is to enable machines to understand and act in the physical world through vision.
