I am currently a Master student in the <a href="https://cmns.umd.edu/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">Department of Computer, Mathematical & Natural Sciences</a> at <a href="https://umd.edu/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">University of Maryland</a>, College Park. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">Shanghaitech University</a>.  In Spring 2023, I was an Exchange Student at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">University of Wisconsin, Madison</a> in Computer Science.

I spent one year as a research assistant advised by <a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/zhanghp/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">Haipeng Zhang</a>. My former research primarily focuses on computer vision and machine learning with a particular emphasis on multimodal systems integrating visual, textual, and structured data. The ultimate objective of my work is to create advanced multimodal systems capable of extracting meaningful data from real-world sources through various carriers, enabling machines and humans to better perceive, understand, and interact with the world around them.

During Undergraduate, I also worked as a Security Engineer Intern for <a href="https://nsfocusglobal.com/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">NSFOCUS</a>, and then joined <a href="https://asia.glodon.com/" style="color:#0060ff;text-decoration: none;">Glodon</a> in position of an Assistant Data Enginner.
