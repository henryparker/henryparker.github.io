👨‍🔬 Hi! I’m a second year graduate student at UMD College Park. 

🔬 My research interests are bridging vision, language and the real world.

📖 Recently, I am working on 3D video scene generation, robot simulation, aerial manipulation, and image generation control using counterfactual methods.

🎯 My short-term goal (next 12 months) is to grow into a reliable and qualified researcher and obtain a PhD position for Fall 2026; My medium-term goal (2 ~ 3 years) is to publish some interesting, high-impact works and collaborate with many outstanding researchers; My long-term goal is to enable machines to understand and reason the causal relation in the physical world through vision, prior knowledge and physics-aware intelligence.
